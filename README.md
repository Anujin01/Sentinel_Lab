<h1>SIEM Analytics: Failed Logins & GeoData in Sentinel</h1>


<h2>ðŸŒŽDescription</h2>
<b>This project sets up a honeypot using an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposed to the internet. It logs failed RDP login attempts, extracts attacker IP addresses, and maps them to geographic locations using Azure Sentinel.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on PowerShell scripts for geolocation lookup, this project ingests a pre-existing IP-to-Geolocation dataset into Sentinel, making log queries faster, cleaner, and more scalable.</b>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Features:</h2>

<b>Real-time attack visualization using Microsoft Sentinel.</b><br>
<b>IP Geolocation tracking of potential attackers.</b><br>
<b>Custom KQL queries for log analysis.</b><br>
<b>Simulated vulnerable services to attract attackers.</b>

<h2>ðŸ”§ Here's how I set it up</h2>

 <ol>
    <li>Azure Subscription: Started by creating a free 12-month Azure subscription.</li>
    <li>Resource Group: Set up a resource group to organize resources efficiently.</li>
    <li>Virtual Network & Machines: Deployed a virtual network and virtual machines, intentionally leaving the firewall off to make the environment more enticing to attackers.</li>
    <li>Log Analytics Workspace: Created a Log Analytics workspace to capture incoming traffic and track attacker sources.</li>
    <li>Microsoft Sentinel: Used Microsoft Sentinel to monitor and analyze malicious activities.</li>
    <li>Mapping Attack Sources: Created a detailed attack map to visualize where the attacks were coming from.</li>
  </ol>



<h2>Languages used</h2>
<b> Kusto Query Language (KQL) â€“ Used in Azure Sentinel for querying and analyzing logs.</b>
